This project is an API integrated with HSQL db. There are 4 domains which are connected to each other with different relationships. Employing efficient techniques like lazy loading and data transfer objects, the API selectively transmits only essential data, optimizing performance. To ensure the functionality of all features, comprehensive Postman tests have been meticulously documented within the project's resources.
